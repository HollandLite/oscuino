OSCuino is a full-featured implementation of the OSC 1.0 communication protocol for Arduino.

Features:

- Supports the four basic OSC data types (integers, floats, strings, and blobs)
- Send and receive messages over any transport layer that implements the Arduino’s Stream - Class such as Serial, EthernetUdp, MIDI, and more.
- Address pattern matching
- Static memory consumption
- Compatible with Arduino 1.0 API and coding style
- 64-bit timetags

OSCuino is composed of two classes: oMESSAGE and oBUNDLE. oMESSAGE contains the address, type, and data and oBUNDLE is a bundle of oMESSAGEs with a timetag. To start sending data over the Arduino’s Serial port simply construct an oBUNDLE with Serial as the constructor argument, add some oMESSAGEs with some data, and send it off:


#include <oMESSAGE.h>
#include <oBUNDLE.h>

void setup(){
   Serial.begin(57600);
}

oBUNDLE bndl(Serial);

void loop(){
  bndl.addMessage("/analog/0").add(analogRead(0));
  bndl.addMessage("/analog/1").add(analogRead(1)); 
  bndl.send();  
}
